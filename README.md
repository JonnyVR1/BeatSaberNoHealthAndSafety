# BeatSaberNoHealthAndSafety
A plugin to skip the health and safety warning at the beginning of the game.
It works by automatically pressing the "Continue" button after a short delay. It has no configuration or interface.
Do not use this mod if you need the warning in order to stay healthy and safe.
